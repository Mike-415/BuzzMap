# BuzzMap

BuzzMap is a mobile application that displays user-generated news or events on a map as pins. The events can be current (occurring within the last 24 hours) or scheduled for the future. Users can also create side quests, which are location-based requests that other users can complete. BuzzMap also allows users to record videos of events and share them with others.
